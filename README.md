Hello
My name is Adela Melinte and I did a project on Jira for Opencart.
Opencart is a website from where you can buy small electronics (Laptops, phone, cameras) and software. It is accessible to everyone.
The file added contains notes on the project, what was tested, how and the results of the tests.
The file is a Test Plan for the website Opencart.
