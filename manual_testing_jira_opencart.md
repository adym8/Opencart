## Testing process
The test process was performed based on the standard test process as described below.
### 1.1 Test planning
The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the Search Bar,  Laptops&Notebooks and Extras: Purchase a Gift Certificate modules from the Opencart  Demo application.
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan. The test plan that was created for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dmDYsLbTbX8OqOLT9DObeED9qfx1ScolIMUKgqpKdFo/edit)

</table>

### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined
- Business requirements written by the analyst are completed and available
- Roles and responsibilities divided and acknowledged
- Projects risks identified and dealt with
- Deadlines established
- Team is informed about the testing process

### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined
- 95% tests passed 
- No critical issues with opened status
- All tests with a higher risk were completed 
- The deadline has been reached
- The budget has been reached
- Update test are 100% passed
- All defects have been documented and communicated to stakeholders

### 1.1.4 Test scope
**Tests in scope**:
Functional (smoke testing, positive, negative), non-functional testing (usability testing, performance testing - stress, load, volume, spike), portability tests, GUI and maintainability tests will be performed during the testing. In the end we will retest and also do a regression testing.

**Tests not in scope**:
Out of scope will be Automation Testing. 
Also the rest of the other modules with the exception of Search Bar, Laptops and Notebooks and Extras (Purchase a Gift Card) are out of scope. 

### 1.1.5 Risks detected
**Project risks**:
- Not enough time allocated to finish all the tests
- QA team does not enough members / holiday season 
- Lack of knowledge with the areas tested
- Changes within the management

**Product risks**:
- Stability risks
- Not supported on all browsers
- Website impacted by stress conditions
### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria
The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control
Test Monitoring and Control was done almost on a daily basis with periodic reports. Based on these reports we implemented new tests and saw what needs to be changed.

## 1.4 Test Design
Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad based on the analysis of the specifications. The test cases can be accessed [here](https://itfclasses.atlassian.net/projects/AD?selectedItem=com.thed.zephyr.je__test-cases)


1.5 Test Implementation
The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:
Test environment is completed and working
Smoke testing passed
Permissions given
Thorough understanding of the application flow
Test automation scripts must be ready, if it is necessary
1.6. Test Execution
Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: 

Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: 
The following is a summary of the bugs that have been found 

Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed and retesting will be done for every functionality that was previously failed.
1.7 Test Completion 
As the Exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the appropriate section, this feature is suggested to ‘Go Live’ by the Testing team
The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: 


Test execution chart was generated and can be found below.

The final report shows that a number of 4 tests have failed of a total of 31
A number of 7 total bugs were found, from which the priority is: 1 are high, 2 are medium and 4 low.


All of the 31 tests were executed and approximately 95% of the demands have been covered. Out of all the bugs found, only one is recommended to be fixed before the site is launched (the Search Bar).
[Update: In the meantime the bug for the Search Bos was fixed and it can be used to perform searches]
The rest can be fixed later on and it will not affect the site or the utilization of it.

In conclusion, the Opencart is ready to launch and it will be useful for those who are looking to buy or change a laptop and not only.
